This location is where the templates used for tests are located.

The *.html files are the templates the user writes.
The *.expected.php files are the expected compiled code of the templates.
The *.expected.html files are the expected outputs of the templates to the browser using the test data

If the expected php code or expected html code differs from actual code generated from execution, tests will fail
